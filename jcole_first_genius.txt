First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil

For real, you the only father that I ever knew

I get my bitch pregnant I'ma be a better you

Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville

Fulfilled, listen even back when we was broke my team ill

Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville

Talk to a nigga

One time for my LA sisters

One time for my LA hoes

Lame niggas can't tell the difference

One time for a nigga who knows

Don't save her
